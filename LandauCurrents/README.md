landau-currents
===============

This document walks through the simple calculation of the probability current for the straight and circular gauges for the Landau problem of a uniform everywhere magnetic field. It then examines how a particular choice of the analytic degeneracy function appearing in the circular gauge solution essentially gives the straight gauge solution, with an added phase. This phase cancels with the difference in vector potential in the equation for the probability current to give the exact same current.
