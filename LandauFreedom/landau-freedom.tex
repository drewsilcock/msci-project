\section{Analyticity of $f(x,y)$}

\textbf{Todo:} Find out why $f(x,y)$ has to be analytic

As $f(x,y)$ is analytic, this implies that it is harmonic and thus obeys the
Laplace equation:
\begin{equation}
    \nabla^2 f(x,y) = \partial_x^2 f(x,y) + \partial_y^2 f(x,y) = 0
\end{equation}
As $f(x,y)$ is independent of $z$ so $\partial_z f(x,y)$ is identically null.
This implies that the real and imaginary parts of $f(x,y)$, $f_R = \Re{\left\{ f
\right\}}$ and $f_I = \Im{\left\{ f \right\}}$, also obeys the Laplace equation:
\begin{align}
    \nabla^2 f_R &= 0 \\
    \textrm{and} ~ \nabla^2 f_I &= 0
\end{align}
In addition to this, $f(x,y) ~ \textrm{is analytic} \Leftrightarrow f(x,y)$
obeys Cauchy-Riemann (CR) equations:
\begin{align}
    \partial_x f_R &= \partial_y f_I \\
    \textrm{and} ~ \partial_y f_R &= - \partial_x f_I
\end{align}
These will come in useful shortly when examining $\div{J}$.

\section{Analyticity of $\logg{f(x,y)}$}

If we ignore the vertex points at $f(x,y) = 0$, then we can say that
$\logg{f(x,y)}$ is also harmonic and obeys the Laplace equation. Thus, writing
$f(x,y)$ as $f(x,y) = Fe^{i\phi}$ where $F, \phi \in \mathbb{R}:

\begin{align}
    \nabla^2 \logg{f(x,y)} &= \nabla^2
