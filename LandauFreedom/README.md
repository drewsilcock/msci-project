LandauFreedom
=============

This document describes an analysis of the freedom you are granted when solving the Landau problem in quantum mechanics. Particularly when you solve using the circular gauge and get a factor of the chaotic analytic function f(x,y).

This document examines the relationship between this f(x,y) and the requirement of continuity, rho dot + div J = 0.
