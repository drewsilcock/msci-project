\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In conclusion, we have investigated the methods and consequences of
circumventing the unphysical gauge dependent quantities that are abundant in
quantum physics for the Schr\"odinger equation, and examined the freedoms
associated with the ground state wavefunction and probability current when
choosing a gauge for the Landau problem. Specific attention is given to the
degeneracy function arising from the ground state wavefunction in the circular
gauge, and how its analyticity ensures that the associated probability current
satisfies continuity. The future directions of investigation are then discussed,
with explicit mention of the chaotic analytic function, Aharonov-Bohm effect,
density operator and Wigner quasiprobability distribution.
