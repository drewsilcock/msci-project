\subsection{Chaotic Analytic Function Generation}

To illustrate the difference in the requirements on $\mathbf{J}$ and $f(x,y)$,
we employ a Monte Carlo random analytic function generation technique as
described by Hannay \cite{hannay} and discussed earlier in the literature
section. \Cref{fig:caf} shows a preliminary plot of the isotropic, stationary
random analytic function generated using this method. Future research intends to
extend this to calculating the associated probability current, and comparing it
with a divergenceless current generated such that it has no other requirements.
In other words, $\mathbf{J}$ is randomly generated as
\begin{align}
    \mathbf{J} = \basis{z} \times \nabla \chi,
\end{align}
where $\chi$ is a randomly generated function. This ensures that $\mathbf{J}$
is divergenceless as the curl of the gradient of a scalar field is always
identically null, but enforces no other restrictions. This should illustrate the
difference between the ``typical'' probability currents generated from the
chaotic analytic $f(x,y)$ and from the scalar field $\chi$ and confirm that
analyticity is more stringent than divergencelessness.

\subsection{The Aharonov-Bohm Effect}

When deriving a gauge invariant form of the Schr\"odinger equation, we found
that the reformulation lost full predictive power when encountering
wavefunctions that aren't simply connected. One such instance of this is the
Aharonov-Bohm effect.

The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect states that the electromagnetic potential has an effect
on the wavefunction of a quantum system, even when the electric and magnetic
fields are zero \cite{aharonov-bohm}.

For the magnetic case (as we will consider here), this amounts to the vector
potentials $\mathbf{A}$ affecting the wavefunction independent of the choice of
gauge, without any magnetic field in the region of the wavefunction. This is
often physically explained as an infinitely long solenoid sitting behind a
double slit, causing non-simply connectedness in the overlapping wavefunctions
\cite{aharonov-rohrlich}, as shown in \Cref{fig:magnetic-ab}.  Although the
magnetic field is zero outside of the infinitely thin solenoid, the magnetic
vector potential is not, and it is this that causes a phase shift, as observed
on the screen.

Thus, although the ultimate effect is gauge independent (as it must be as it is
observable), the vector potential is \textit{requried} in the prediction of the
phase shift. Specifically, the phase difference between the two wavefunctions
will be
\begin{align}
    \Delta \phi &= e^{i q \Phi_B / \hbar},
\end{align}
where $\Phi_B = \oint \mathbf{A} \cdot d\mathbf{x}$ is the flux of the vector
potential around the cylinder \cite{aharonov-rohrlich}.

Further investigation will be carried out concerning the AB effect and the
supposed reliance on the gauge dependent potentials, with particular emphasis on
the possibility of additionally freedoms in the problem.

\subsection{The Density Matrix}

Another topic of future investigation is the gauge freedom involved with the
density operator, $\hat \varrho$, given by (using Dirac notation)
\begin{align}
    \varrho = \sum_i p_i \Ket{\psi_i}\bra{\psi_i},
\end{align}
where $p_i$ are the probabilities of the system being in state $\Ket{\psi_i}$,
and the sum is over all possible states such that $\sum_i p_i = 1$.

It is simple to see that this density matrix is independent of any added phase
to the wavefunction;
\begin{align}
    \Ket{\psi} &\rightarrow e^{i \chi} \Ket{\psi} \\
    \sum_i p_i \Ket{\psi_i}\bra{\psi_i} &\rightarrow \sum_i p_i \left( e^{i
    \chi} \Ket{\psi_i} \right) \left( e^{-i \chi} \bra{\psi_i} \right) \notag \\
    &= \sum_i p_i \Ket{\psi_i} \bra{\psi_i}. \notag
\end{align}

Thus, the density operator is gauge invariant. An interesting question, then, is
whether quantum mechanics can be recast in an entirely gauge invariant way using
this density operator formalism. In particular, the time evolution of the
density operator is given by its commutator with the Hamiltonian;
\begin{align}
    i \hbar \dot{\varrho} = \comm{H}{\varrho}.
\end{align}

This means that although the density operator is gauge independent, its time
evolution is generated by the gauge dependent Hamiltonian
\begin{align}
    H &= \frac{1}{2m} \mathbf{\Pi}^2 + qV \\
      &= \frac{1}{2m} \left( \mathbf{p} - q \mathbf{A} \right)^2 + qV.
\end{align}

Future research aims to investigate the degree to which we can circumvent this
gauge dependence, and express such phenomena entirely gauge independently.

\subsection{The Wigner Function}

Another interesting future line of inquest concerns the phase space equivalent
of the density operator: the Wigner function $W(x,p)$. This distribution is
defined in the position representation by
\begin{align}
    W(x,p) &\defeq \frac{1}{\pi \hbar} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \psi^*(x+y)
    \psi(x-y) e^{\frac{2ipy}{\hbar}} dy \\
    &= \frac{1}{\pi \hbar} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \Braket{\psi|x+y}
    \Braket{x-y|\psi} e^{\frac{2ipy}{\hbar}} dy \\
    &= \frac{1}{\pi \hbar} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\Braket{x-y|\psi}
    \Braket{\psi|x+y} e^{\frac{2ipy}{\hbar}} dy \\
    &= \frac{1}{\pi \hbar} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \Bra{x-y} \varrho \Ket{x+y}
    e^{\frac{2ipy}{\hbar}} dy \\
    &= \frac{1}{\pi \hbar} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \varrho(x-y,x+y)
    e^{\frac{2ipy}{\hbar}} dy,
\end{align}
where $y$ is simply the half the difference between two points $x - y$ and $x +
y$ \cite{wigner}. In other words, (ignoring constants) the Wigner distribution is the Fourier
transform of the density operator in the position basis, $\varrho(x-y,x+y)$,
with respect to the difference between the two positions, $2y$.

Thus interesting questions arise regarding the gauge invariance of this Wigner
function, and its close relationship with the classical probability density.
Complications arise due to $W(x,p)$ being a \textit{quasi}-probability
distribution, meaning that although it is real everywhere, it can be negative
and therefore can't always represent a probability distribution in the same
classical way.

The time evolution of a Wigner function varying with time is given by the Moyal
equation:
\begin{align}
    \dot W(x,p) = \moyal{H(x,p)}{W(x,p)},
\end{align}
where $\moyal{A}{B}$ is the Moyal bracket of $A$ and $B$ and $H(x,p)$ is the
Hamiltonian on the phase space \cite{moyal}. The Moyal bracket is the phase space version of
the commutator;
\begin{align}
    \moyal{f}{g} &\defeq \frac{1}{i \hbar}\left( f \star g - g \star f \right),
\end{align}
where $f \star g$ is the Moyal product
\begin{align}
    f \star g \defeq fe^{\frac{i \hbar}{2} \left( \overleftarrow \partial_x
        \overrightarrow \partial_p - \overleftarrow \partial_p
        \overrightarrow \partial_x \right)} g.
\end{align}
Note that the direction of the arrow indicates the direction the partial
differentiation acts on; $u \overleftarrow \partial v = \left( \partial u\right)
v$ and $u \overrightarrow \partial v = u \left( \partial v \right)$. Taylor
expanding the Moyal bracket gives
\begin{align}
    \moyal{f}{g} = \poiss{f}{g} + O \left( \hbar^2 \right),
\end{align}
where $\poiss{f}{g}$ is the classical Poisson bracket
\begin{align}
    \poiss{f}{g} = f \left( \overleftarrow \partial_x \overrightarrow \partial_p
    - \overleftarrow \partial_p \overrightarrow \partial_x \right)  g.
\end{align}

Thus, taking the limit of the Moyal equation as $\hbar \rightarrow 0$, one gets
the classical Liouville equation,
\begin{align}
    \dot P(x,p) = \poiss{H(x,p)}{P(x,p)},
\end{align}
where $P(x,p)$ is the classical probability distribution over phase space.

The Wigner function therefore provides a correspondence to classical physics
which could be of interest in the exploration of quantum gauge circumvention;
classically the gauge dependent potentials are useful but are not needed in the
same way that quantum seemingly needs it (as in the Aharonov-Bohm case)
\cite{aharonov-bohm}.
