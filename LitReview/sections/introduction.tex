\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Gauge freedom is a fundamental aspect to the gauge theories which describe
modern physics, from the Higgs mechanism\cite{higgs-1964} to the etc...

The basic aim of this project is to 

We begin with a review of the limited literature concerning the circumvention of
gauge dependent variables, gauge freedoms in the Landau problem and associated
concepts. Secondly, the Schr\"odinger equation, the fundamental equation of dynamics
of quantum mechanics, is reformulated in gauge independent variables and the
scope of this reformulation is discussed. Next, the Landau problem is
investigated in the gauge freedoms associated with the ground state in various
gauges. The symmetries of the ground states are discussed in these gauges.
