Gauge freedom is fundamental to our modern description of physics in the
standard model, but it is merely a mathematical superfluity that helps with
calculations. It is therefore possible to formulate quantum physics without
these gauge dependent quantities. This project explores the consequences of
attempting to rewrite quantum phenomena in gauge invariant terms. The
Schr\"odinger equation is reformulated in gauge invariant variables, the degrees
of freedom are investigated for the Landau problem and the future direction of
investigation is discussed, with particular reference to the Aharonov-Bohm
effect, density operator and Wigner quasiprobability distribution.
